Steps
1. npx create-expo-app appName
2. cd appName
3. npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto expo-web-browser react-native-web react-dom 
 @expo/webpack-config @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
4. Go to google cloud(need google account)
    - Create a new project
        - Name it. Dont pick industry or whatever the second question was
    - Press 'select project' once it's done being created
    - Need an OAuth client ID for applications
        - in this case, we'll need three (one for android, ios and web)
    - Go to navigation on the left side of the screen and select 'APIs and Services' --> 'Enabled APIs and Services'
    - Select 'Credentials' then at the top select 'Create credentials' --> 'OAuth client ID'
    - Select 'Configure consent screen' --> 'External' --> 'Create'
    - Enter app name and support email(where user can contact you or someone else)
    - Scroll all the way down to 'Developer contact information' and enter another email
    - Select 'Save and Continue'
        - If you run into error, include the project ID into the app name as well (i.e like with vigilant-willow-407302 for google tutorial)
    - Select 'Save and Continue' on Scopes screen as well
    - Select 'Save and Continue' on Test Users as well if there are no test Users
    - If everything looks right, scroll all the way down and select 'Back to Dashboard'
    - Go back to 'Credentials' --> 'Create credentials' --> 'OAuth client ID'
    - From drop down menu, select application type
        - For Web application:
         - under 'Authorized Java Origins' press 'Add URL'
          - to get URL/run web, run npx expo --web --https
          - copy URL link and paste it into 'Authorized Java Origins" --> 'URL 1'(in this case, its https://localhost:19006)
          - under 'Authorized redirect URLs' press 'Add URL' and paste that same url link over to here as well
         - once done, press 'Create' 
         - if the app is already deployed, you will need to provide your domain and/or the actual link for your web app 
         instead of the localhost one
         - OAuth Client credentials and such should appear now
         - copy the Client ID --> in app.js, paste it as a comment (i.e. //508324923582-colqt82dke17aa8n8n51msqric08j9sm.apps.googleusercontent.com)
         - Stop the server and gather the ID's for android and IOS next
         - close out of 'OAuth Client Created' box by pressing 'ok'

         -For IOS:
            - back on the 'Credentials' screen --> 'Create Credentials' --> 'OAuth client ID' 
            - select application type as IOS of course
            - need bundle ID
                - run npx expo prebuild
                - keep package name as default that appears once ran so just hit 'enter' 
                - if ios doesn't appear, just type in "bundleIdentifier": "com.itsasma11world.tutorialgoogle" 
                within app.json ("com.itsasma11world.tutorialgoogle" is the default name)
                - go to app.json, under ios find "bundleIdentifier": "defaultName" --> copy and paste that into 
                'Bundle ID' on google cloud
            - select 'Create' --> copy Client ID --> paste as comment in app.js for ios like with web


        - For Android:
            - back on the 'Credentials' screen --> 'Create Credentials' --> 'OAuth client ID' 
            - select application type as android of course
            - go to app.json, under android find "package": "defaultName" --> copy and past that into
            'package name' on google cloud
            - need a "SHA-1 certificate fingerprint"
             - to get this, run expo credentials:manager
             - this will ask you for which platform, select android of course --> select 'y'
             - Then, select 'Update upload Keystore' --> 'Generate new Keystore' --> 'Go back to experience overview'
             - SHA-1 should now pop up as "Google Certificate Hash(SHA-1): someNumber" --> copy that someNumber
             - hit ctrl + c to stop running
             - paste 'someNumber' into 'SHA-1 certificate fingerprint in google cloud"
             - select "Create"
             - copy Client ID and paste is as a comment in app.js

5. In app.js, import "import * as WebBrowser from "expo-web-browser";"
    - then type "WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession();"
6. In app.js, import "import * as Google from 'expo-auth-session/providers/google' "
7. Then, also import "import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage"; "
8. Then, also import "import * as React from 'react'; "
9. "const[userInfo, setUserInfo] = React.useState(null);"
